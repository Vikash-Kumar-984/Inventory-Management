# FactoryFlow - Manufacturing Inventory Management System

## Website Deployment on Google Firebase: https://inventory-58bee.web.app/

## 1. Project Description

FactoryFlow is a comprehensive, real-time web application designed for small to medium-sized manufacturing businesses. It provides a centralized dashboard to manage the entire production lifecycle, from tracking raw materials and defining product recipes to logging sales and managing manufacturing orders.

This tool is built to replace complex spreadsheets and provide a clear, live overview of your business operations, helping you make informed decisions about stock levels, purchasing, and production priorities.

## 2. Core Features

* **üìä Interactive Dashboard:** A high-level overview of key business metrics, including total revenue, open sales orders, and low-stock alerts for both products and materials.
* **üì¶ Raw Materials Management:** Keep a detailed record of all your raw materials, including stock levels, suppliers, cost per unit, and reorder points.
* **üõçÔ∏è Products Master:** A master list of all finished goods you produce. Each product has a unique SKU, selling price, and a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** that defines its "recipe."
* **üõí Sales Order Tracking:** Log sales from various online platforms (like Flipkart, Myntra, etc.). The system automatically deducts stock from finished goods inventory.
* **üè≠ Manufacturing Management:** Create manufacturing orders to produce new batches of your products. The system automatically checks for sufficient raw materials based on the product's BOM and deducts them from inventory when production begins. When production is complete, the finished goods stock is automatically updated.
* **ÂÄâÂ∫´ (Warehouse) Live Inventory View:** A real-time snapshot of all your stock levels, highlighting items that are running low and need attention.
